### This is the greatest universe(s?) of all time.
Our database consists of our own universe and it captures everything within it.

We are creating a universe of our own to contextualize the universe and catalogue all the vast taxonomies within. Users can focus on a broad view of the billions of galaxies in the universe, delve into a particular solar system to learn more about its central star, surrounding planets, and their moons,or look at the many biomes, ecosystems, and discovered life forms on a particular planet. Teachers could use the system to outline the connections between our earth and the surrounding stars, and scientific researchers can use (and update) the data to predict which stars are candidates for supernova or impending black hole. # Spacify
