Creating a universe of our own to contextualize the universe and catalogue all the vast taxonomies within. Users can focus on a broad view of the billions of galaxies in the universe, delve into a particular solar system to learn more about its central star, surrounding planets, and their moons,or look at the many biomes, ecosystems, and discovered life forms on a particular planet. The system can be used to outline the connections between our earth and the surrounding stars, and scientific researchers can use (and update) the data to predict which stars are candidates for supernova or impending black hole.
